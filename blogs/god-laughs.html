      <h4 class="date">April 27, 2016</h4>
  		<div class="text">
        <p>It's been a while since my last post, but tomorrow is my birthday. I've been reflecting on this last year and I must admit,
  		I am not where I thought I'd be at 27 years old. Looking back over this last year,
  		 I've realized that I've made almost no momentum in anything towards my future.
  		 That's not to say this last year wasn't good; in fact this last year was probably
  		 one of the best years of my life! I went to New York for two months, studied acting,
  		  made amazing friends and even saw one come to Christ, it was great! Apart from
  		  that, this last year was really just a great experience. An experience that may
  		  or may not have any lasting value in building towards my future goals. But isn't
  		  that what life is? Just a collection of experiences? </p>
        <p>The reason I bring all this up is well, I'm sure you've all heard of the old yiddish proverb "A man makes plans,
  		  God laughs." I've had numerous plans over the last 6 years since moving to
  		  Washington only to see them fall to pieces, leaving me asking myself "What on earth
  		  am I doing with my life?" That being said, I am not exactly discontent where I
  		  am at. I have a great job that I worked three years to get promoted to, I have
  		  great friends, a great living situation, so I'm not exactly lost without a paddle.
  		  But what I'm asking myself is, where am I going? I seem to meet people who know
  		  exactly what they want in life; they have a career they're working towards,
  		  they're making progress. But me? I don't know where I am going. I feel like a
  		  vagabond wondering around aimlessly looking for his destination.</p>
        <p> I'm also reminded of the Proverb "A man's heart plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps." (16:9)
  		  I firmly believe in this as well. I'm not one who gives to the way of thinking
  		  that I have to run every decision through God as if I'm walking a thin line having
  		  to get permission for every step I take. God really does want us to make decisions
  		  for ourselves, He gives us boundaries not orders. I do have goals and plans,
  		  but as those famous Rolling Stone's lyrics states "you can't always get what you
  		   want." And I'm also not one who buys into the whole "God has a wonderful plan
  		   for your life" scenario either. And don't even quote me Jeremiah 29:11, that
  		   verse was a promise for a certain people and a certain time, namely Israel.</p>
        <p>  I believe God does have a plan, but who am I to say it's going to be wonderful?
  		    What of our Christian brothers and sisters across the globe getting beaten and
  		    beheaded what of their wonderful plan? What if I die tomorrow? What if I find
  		    out I have cancer? What if I get in a car accident and am crippled the rest of
  		    my life? These things happen to people every day, (yes Christians too!). I'm
  		    not trying to be negative, I'm just trying to get back to reality and pull my
  		    head out of the clouds, where I feel so many Christians are right now, especially
  		    in America. The church in America today has it easier than any other time in
  		    history, yet we complain so much (myself included), and we get offended at the
  		    stupidest things. </p>
          <p>So all that being said, instead I should really be asking myself
  		    "What you got to complain about?" Nothing. Literally nothing. Well this blog
  		    really didn't go the way I thought it was going to go when I started it. Turns
  		    out we all just need to be content wherever we're at. This is probably the messiest
  		    blog I've written, my thoughts aren't exactly organized sorry about that. Well,
  		    here's to another year! Let's see what happens.</p>
