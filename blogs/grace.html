    		I've got to thinking about God's grace recently, and no matter how much you ponder
    		it, it is unfathomable to say the least. I've recently had discussions on eternal
    		security, and this post is not to prove anyone wrong or put down anyone who believes
    		otherwise, but this is my own opinion from what I have gleaned from scripture. I guess
    		the way I look at God's grace is the same way I look at his wrath, but on the opposite
    		spectrum. The sinner is a target of God's wrath and unless redeemed, he cannot escape
    		from it. No valley, mountain, hill, darkness or ocean can hide a man from the wrath of
    		God. When it comes, it will consume him and destroy him. It is inescapable. The same
    		goes for God's grace! The saint is a target of God's grace, he cannot escape from it.
    		No valley, mountain, hill, darkness or ocean can hide a saint from the grace of God.
    		When it comes, it will consume him and restore him. It is inescapable." For I am sure
    		that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to
    		come, nor powers nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be
    		able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 8:38-39)
    		So the way I see it, once we are saved, we are saved.</p>
        <p> We cannot lose our salvation. After all, Jesus Himself said "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish,
    		and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is
    		greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand."
    		(John 10:28-29) Once we are saved we are in His hands, and nothing can take us out
    		of them, and last I checked, nothing meant, well, nothing. We cannot out sin God's
    		grace, because God knew all our sins before we even commit them and already paid for
    		them. When a Christian falls into unrepentant sin, God disciplines them, He doesn't
    		take away His grace. "My son, do not scorn the Lord's discipline or give up when he
    		corrects you. "For the Lord disciplines the one he loves and chastises every son he
    		accepts." Endure your suffering as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For
    		what son is there that a father does not discipline?" (Hebrews 12:5-7) Or when you
    		look at Paul's letter to the Corinthians, when dealing with their sexual sins. One
    		man took his father's wife, and they were proud, unrepentant! But Paul was still
    		writing to them as believers. He even commanded that the man be disciplined and
    		turned over to Satan so his soul would be saved! (1 Corinthians 1:5) I don't think
    		this man's salvation was ever in question, I think Paul was using strong language to
    		get them to discipline him and dis-fellowship him until he repented. But even if he
    		was destroyed by Satan, he still would have been saved! "you are to deliver this man
    		to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the
    		day of the Lord." (1 Corinthians 1:5) So not even committing unrepentant sexual
    		sin with your father's wife which leads to destruction from Satan can separate you
    		from God's grace! Wow! I mean seriously, wow, and you thought God's wrath was scary?</p>
    	    <p>Now this obviously doesn't give us liberty to sin, (Romans 6:1-2). The true believer
    	    will eventually come to repentance by God's discipline and by a change of heart.
    	    Now what I say next is my own belief, but for the believer who falls into hard
    	    unrepentant sin, what of him? Well I believe that for him, after being disciplined
    	    and still unrepentant, God will have no other choice than to bring him home, for I
    	    think God would rather have him there in heaven with Him than on earth giving God a
    	    bad name by living a sinful lifestyle, after all, God gave us the responsibility of
    	    representing Him on earth. That is why I believe Paul used such strong language in
    	    dealing with the man sleeping with his father's wife. He commanded for him to be
    	    turned over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, to perhaps even die! Why?
    	    So that his soul would be saved! Paul would rather have this man's flesh destroyed
    	    by Satan and his soul go to heaven, than him stay on earth and give the church a
    	    bad reputation. Again, that is my own personal belief on an unrepentant believer.
    	    I guess another way to look at it is to view grace as what it is, undeserved
    	    merited favor. So how can we ever un-deserve something we didn't deserve in the
    	    first place?</p>
          <p> I write this to give those who sometimes question their salvation at
    	    times peace, for God bought you with a price, his blood. And nothing, not even you
    	    yourself, can take yourself back from that payment once you have accepted it. You
    	    sold yourself to God, you are his. Just like if you bought a tv from a store with
    	    a no return policy. The store owner has no right to come into your home and take
    	    it back, because you bought it, and you also can't take it back to the store
    	    because it has a no return policy. Well, God's grace has a no return policy sorry!
    	    No exceptions! You were bought with the precious blood of Christ, and if you have truly
    	    accepted that in faith, then there are no returns accepted, guaranteed!
