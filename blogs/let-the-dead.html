          I'd like to think that my blogs have been rather consistent, being that my main purpose for writing is to 
          decrease myself and increase Him.  To take the focus of our circumstances or emotions, and to not be led by them,
          but by the Spirit. To count the cost in following Christ, while forsaking all others.  One particular passage, and a famous
          one at that, I think speaks to this rather well. In Matthew's account, Jesus has just finished healing many people who were
          sick and oppressed by demons, but two men singled him out:

        </p>

        <blockquote>
                And a scribe came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go." And Jesus said to him, 
                "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head." 
                Another of the disciples said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father." 
                And Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.
                <br>
                -Matthew 8:19-22
        </blockquote>

          We have two men, two separate and opposite responses, yet we can assume both walked away without following Christ.
          What did they do wrong, especially the first one?  One would think that that's the <i>exact</i> response we should have at
          following Christ! Well it is... but you see we respond with our heart, not with our mouth.  This is why I am not a proponent 
          of "the sinner's prayer", as if by some utterance of syllables from our mouths removes the stains from our souls.  No, it is and 
          always has been <b>the heart</b> that God responds to.
      </p>

      <p>
          Let's look at this first man's response, he claims to want to follow Jesus wherever he goes... and Christ responds with
          <i>"Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."</i>
          Jesus is always revealing what He sees in people's hearts... He freaked the Pharisee's out when He spoke 
          their thoughts about Him having the authority to forgive sins.  With that, we must assume that Jesus is responding
          not to this man's words or his request, but to what is secretly lying in his heart. We can gather from Jesus' response that
          He is (as always) testing him. From His response of claiming to be homeless, we can assume that this man thought he had a lot to gain
          from following Christ. Perhaps he thought that this "healing gig" was pretty lucrative and would bring him riches or pay off 
          his debts.  Perhaps he wanted to follow Christ for the prestige and reputation, but Christ was revealing to him that no such
          reputation exists... he will be hated and have nowhere to lie his head.  Simply put, he didn't want to follow Christ 
          for the sake of Christ.

          I think this speaks <i>volumes</i> and is <b>so very</b> relevant today. In America, we essentially have two counterfeit gospels: Prosperity and Progressive.
          The first promises health, wealth and prosperity to anyone who follows Him (you just need to have enough faith!)  In most cases, it is just a con by evil men 
          to sheer the sheep.  The latter, however, I have sympathy for, as (unlike the former), many (if not most) who believe in progressive 
          Christianity are sincere "honest" people. Being that they are honest in their sincerity, but are sincerely wrong.  Unlike the former, progressive 
          Christianity's focus isn't on health/wealth, but on morals, social justice, and humanism.  Neither's focus is on following Christ for the sake of Christ.
          The former follows Christ for health and money, and the latter follows Christ to make them and others feel better about themselves and to boost 
          their self-esteem while telling them "just be a good person and God will love you for that."  Both are false, and both don't answer the question to the gospel call.
          Many believe the gospel call is <i>"Do you want to go to heaven?"</i>, when in reality the true gospel call is <i>"Do you want God?"</i> 
          Too many people make rash decisions to follow Christ because they are wanting to follow Him under false pretenses.  Either because they were given a false gospel,
          or because they have their own selfish desires they believe Christ will fulfill. It is obvious from Christ's response that this man didn't want God, but something 
          else entirely.  Matthew Henry comments on this man's response, saying:

      <blockquote>
            Now we should think ourselves sure of such a man as this; and yet it appears, by Christ's answer, that his resolution was rash, his ends low and carnal: either he 
            did not consider at all, or not that which was to be considered; he saw the miracles Christ wrought, and hoped he would set up a temporal kingdom, and he wished to 
            apply betimes for a share in it. Note, There are many resolutions for religion, produced by some sudden pangs of conviction, and taken up without due consideration, 
            that prove abortive, and come to nothing: soon ripe, soon rotten.
            <br>
            -Matthew Henry
      </blockquote>

      <p>
         <i> "Soon ripe, soon rotten."</i> If this doesn't describe young adults in the American church!... But now to Christ's response for the second man.
         This is perhaps the more well known verse, as Christ responds <i>"Leave the dead to bury their own dead"</i> to a man who apparently has good reasons
         and intentions.  It's not that he "doesn't want" to follow Christ, he has <i>more important</i> matters to attend to first.  We must make note that Jesus isn't 
         being insensitive here, this man's father isn't actually dead.  It was Jewish custom to bury your dead with a day after their death, followed by at least a week of 
         mourning. If this man's father was truly dead, or had just died, he would have been busy attending to his washing and burial and wouldn't have been there that day.
         It is more likely that this man's father was well and alive, and this man is requesting to finish his duties with his father until the time of his death, <i>then</i>
         he will follow Him.  Again, we must also read Jesus' response in the context of Him looking at his heart.  If this man's father <i>was</i> truly dead, and this man
         <i>was</i> indeed sincere about following Him, I honestly don't find it too far fetched that Christ wouldn't have allowed for a man to honor his father buy burying him, after all,
         that was the first commandment that came with a promise.  Jesus even rebukes the Pharisees later in Matthew 15 because they <i>dishonored</i> their father and mother by
         giving to God rather than to their parents. You honor God <i>by</i> honoring your parents, not in spite of them. Now true, Jesus does also state 
         <i>"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple."</i>, 
         but of course Jesus wasn't speaking <i>literally</i>.  Jesus most often spoke in parables and metaphors, as when He said <i>"If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it 
         out...if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off" </i> This isn't about hating our parents, but loving God first and foremost and forsaking all others... so to them, it may
         look like hate... that you chose God over them, but I digress.
      </p>

          It is between these two men's responses that I believe a lot of people in the church fall.  Those who are lukewarm, or those who are cold.  Those who are passionate about following Christ 
          under false pretenses, and those who put it off for another day. Christ would rather you <i>not</i> follow Him than 
          have your empty promises of getting around to it.  He would rather you be cold, than lukewarm. Guys, it's all or nothing... this is what Christ wants.  As Paul says in Romans 12:1
          <i>"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service." (NKJV)</i>
          By saying <i>"reasonable service"</i>, he is essentially saying <i>"it's the least you can do."</i>  Other translations state it is our <i>"spiritual worship",</i> being that our entire lives
          should be placed on the altar, our entire lives should be an act of worship. God commanded us to "Love the Lord your God with all your 
          heart, mind, soul, and strength."  
      </p>

      <p>
          This, of course, isn't possible. As Paul Washer said: <i>"There has never been a human being on this planet, of all the thousands of years of humanity, of all the billions of people 
          who have walked this earth, <b>there has never been</b> of all that mass, not one person who for one fraction of a second loved the Lord their God with all their heart, soul, mind and strength."</i>  
          So what are we to do? Well, this is where grace comes in. The person who is heart-bent on following Christ isn't going to care 
          how many times he falls down.  Just look at who Christ ministered to! Who did He reveal Himself to first? The adulteress woman at the well.  He's not calling 
          perfect people to follow Him, He's calling imperfect people to follow Him.  And why do we follow Him? <b><i>Because</i></b> we're imperfect.
          It's recognizing that we will never be <i>good enough</i>. We follow Christ and love Christ because He first loved us, because we want Him... not because 
          we want to feel better about ourselves or because we want that new car. It's not how well you follow, but why and for whom you're following.
          This is what Christ was responding to in those men.  The first man seemed ready to follow Him to the ends of the earth, and implied he would "follow well",
          but he wanted to follow for the wrong reasons.  The same for the other man, as he wanted to delay following for 
          the wrong reasons.
      </p>

      <p>
        In closing, I would ask that you evaluate yourself and ask God to search your heart. Have you been falling
        in between these two responses lately? If so, repent.  God is always gracious. <i>"There is no condemnation for those 
        in Christ Jesus"</i>  Remember, it's not how well you follow, but <i>why</i> and <i>whom</i> you are following.  Renew that
        desire and love that brought you to Christ before worldy distractions drew you away.  Renew your daily Bible time before other 
        less important tasks which you thought were more important took over.  Let not your response be of selfish gain or procrastination, but
        fall on your knees and repent daily.  This is the Christian walk. It's not a sprint, it's a marathon. A marathon full of
        potholes and sinkholes that you will fall into along the way. Some may keep you trapped for days, weeks, months, or even years, but 
        Christ promises to "complete the work" that He began.  If you are to bury your dead, let it be that you are burying the old man and that you are 
        dying to sin daily.
