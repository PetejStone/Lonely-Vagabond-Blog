        <p>As of late, I have really had my priorities out of whack...and until
          this last week, I will admit that I had really been slacking on my
          Bible reading. Why? Because well, as I said, my priorities are out of
          whack. To make Jesus the core, the center of all you do can be the
          hardest thing. David (who was a man after God's own heart) saw to have
          a woman's husband killed after committing adultery with her. So maybe I
          shouldn't beat myself up so much when I fall short… I mean when is the
          last time I killed a guy for sleeping with his wife, right? Wrong. My sin
          is ever before God. And even though it is covered by grace, it still
          separates me from His presence just as much as David's sins. The reality
          of it is my sin has a foundation, and it is rooted in my priorities.
          The simple fact that I held Jesus where he ought naught was a sin in
          it of itself, and it's a breeding ground for even more.</p>
           <p>I'm a man (if not still a boy) who has made many mistakes. Mistakes
          that have broken me in pieces, shaped me, molded me, and by the grace of God
          directed me back towards His presence. It's almost an endless cycle.
          I put Jesus first and things are swell, my priorities shift, sin enters,
          repentance…rinse and repeat. Each time I fall back on Jesus it is much
          sweeter than the last, but at the same time my sin can get much worse.
          I have a spirit who longs for Christ while dwelling in a body that is the
          complete antithesis of that. I have desires, but God desires me. That
          should be enough! While I may desire so many things, He desires one thing,
          and that's my heart. As His bride, He courted us by presenting Himself
          before our heavenly Father, and His grace has been chasing me ever
          since. I may try to run from it, ignore it if I may, but it is always
          there, beckoning me to return. I don't know what the purpose of this
          blog is... to relate? If I only have Jesus in this life and nothing else,
          that is enough. I may die without ever having my desires fulfilled, but
          my number one desire of having Jesus will be. That is all I need.</p>
