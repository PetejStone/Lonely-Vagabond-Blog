      <h2>Desire:Is It Sinful?</h2>
      <h4 class="date">May 29, 2013</h4>
      <div class="text">
        <p>There I questions I ask myself, and God, that I still ponder quite
          often.  I recently read a blog from a friend on discontentment and it
          got me thinking how I myself am not content.  I am perfectly content
          in life concerning friends, job, where I live, finances, etc., but the
          one thing I can never seem to be content with is well, singleness.
          Over and over again it is said that God is more than enough for us, and
          yes that is true, but even in the most healthy times of my spiritual walk
          I still desire to have a wife and a family.  Is this wrong?  Even though I
          have Jesus, to desire another lover?  To have that desire be more than Him,
          yes that is wrong, but is it okay to not be content with the single life,
          even though Jesus is supposed to be more than enough?</p>

        <p>I look back at the beginning when God created Adam, when everything
          was by His original design and how He intended everything to be.  Adam
          was in the beginning sinless, a perfect man.  He walked with God in the
          garden, had the most perfect relationship with God than any mortal man
          has ever had because it was the way God intended it to be...but even Adam,
          in His perfect relationship with God, desired a wife.  And God Himself
          said <i>"It is not good for man to be alone"</i> (Genesis 2:18).  It was
          because of Adam's loneliness that God created Eve, to be a helper to him.
          But how could Adam be alone if he was in perfect fellowship with God?
          And if it wasn't good for a perfect man to be alone and God saw his need
          for a wife, how much more is that need to be met in sinful men?  That is
          why it is said <i>"He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor
          from the Lord."</i>  and that she is <i>"more precious than rubies."</i>
          (Proverbs 18:22, 31:10).</p>

        <p>Is this desire I have God given, or is it unfruitful because it shows
          my discontentment with having just God?  What about Adam and his desire?
          Well God is omnipotent, He knows everything past, future and present.
          Did God purposefully create Adam alone to spark in him a desire for a
          wife so that when God provided her, Adam would value her more?  I think
          so.  Adam wasn't complete yet, because man and wife are one.  God wasn't
          finished with Adam, yet he allowed Adam some time alone on the earth
          to realize he needed someone other than God to meet his earthly desire,
          then God provided for that desire. Ultimately speaking, God was still
          filling every part of Adam's heart.  God  intentionally created Adam
          with a wife shaped hole in His heart that was provided by Him, so in the
          end, God is still the one filling that hole.  Now as fallen sinful men
          our hearts are completely broken and we are looking for anything to fill
          it, be it materials, money, and yes, a wife (or husband... don't want this
          entire blog to be one sided).  But material possessions are hardly ever
          a desire put into us from God, we just want it because we want it.  But
          a spouse?  Well that is the one earthly, discernible and tangible desire
          I can think of that could very well be from God.</p>

        <p>Basically what I am getting at is, is it still wrong to be discontent and want
          something more, or someone rather, other than God?  Because we are fallen
          men now, our original design is marred, which means all of our desires,
          passions, and our very nature is broken.  So have things changed?  We are
          the bride of Christ now yes, but He still allows and wills earthly spousal
          relationships.  Is that desire still God given as it was in the beginning,
          even though everything else from the beginning has been skewed?  I ask
          because I do not know.  I desire a wife and a family very much, but many
          would tell me to just be content with Jesus and she will eventually come.
          Well what if she doesn't?  There are probably countless people in history,
          perhaps godly people even, who have desired spouses and died before they ever
          got a chance.  So where is the line drawn?  Is it sin for me to not be content
          now, even though it wasn't for Adam?  I do not know, that is why I ask
          these questions, but it is time I wrapped this up.</p>

        <p>To be clear, I am not miserable and hating my life because I am single,
          I am just simply not content with being single, I believe there is a
          difference.  I still have the joy of the Lord and love Him more than anything,
          but I am still not content with singleness, and all I ask is, is it wrong?
          What are your thoughts?</p>
