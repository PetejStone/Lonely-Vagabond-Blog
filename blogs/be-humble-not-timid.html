      <h2>Be Humble Not Timid</h2>

        <p>We know that it is the "Christian" thing to be humble. Some can take
           it as far as to not think highly of themselves at all, as if taking
           any pride in what they do is a sin. Let me tell you something...it's not.
            I've experienced many instances where I've complimented a Pastor,
             guest speaker or worship team on their good work or message they
             brought. Instead of receiving the compliment with a simple "thank
             you", they say "Oh, don't thank me, thank God", or "Praise the Lord"
             or something along those lines. I will admit it, I've done it too.
             There is something uncomfortable about saying "thank you" to someone
             who just complimented you on a message you brought or something you
             shared that came from God.</p>

        <p>To change perspectives here, it can actually be insulting to the person
          giving the compliment when you don't receive it.. or even worse, it can make
          you appear more arrogant, which is the one thing you are trying to avoid!
          How so? Well, simply put... It can come off as a parade of humility, that
          you're being humble on purpose for others to see just how truly humble
          you are...which is the complete antithesis of true humility. Do we do this
          on purpose? Well I bet most of us don't. It is not our intention to come
          off that way. Now I can't speak for others who have done this, but when
          I've neglected compliments in the past out of not wanting to appear
          prideful, the exact opposite happens after. What do I mean? Well, almost
          a year ago I shared a message at Calvary Campus Church. After the service,
          many people came and complimented me on what I shared. Instead of saying
          "thank you" I in turn just said, "Oh praise the Lord".</p>

        <p>Body language is 80-90% of communication, so other than people telling
          me "wow, jerk" through body language, I had a small voice inside that
          said "Hey hey, you didn't take any of the glory. That's pretty humble of
          you. You're looking pretty righteous right now, not accepting those
          compliments...go you". Yep. I succeeded in "appearing" humble, but failed
          in truly being humble. And I think that is the problem. Too many of us
          focus on "appearing" humble to the rest of the world, when God simply
          tells us to just, well, be humble. How do we do this? We look to Christ
          as our example.</p>

        <p>In Philippians 2 Paul gives us an example of Christ's humility.</p>

        <blockquote>"Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory, but in
          lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves. Do not
          let each man look upon his own things, but each man also on the things
          of others. For let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,
          who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with
          God, but made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Himself the form
          of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. And being found in
          fashion as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death,
          even the death of the cross. "</blockquote>

        <p>You see, some have this mindset that we can't have any pride or self-esteem
          at all. As if to say "thank you" is a sin when sharing something God gave
          to us, or when we even do anything good at all. It's almost as if we think
          we need to have low self-esteem to be humble, to think lowly of ourselves
          and give all praise to God because we are worthless pieces of you know what.
          Guess what. That's not what we are. We were that before we came to Christ,
          but God bought us and made us His bride, and no good bridegroom would call
          his bride worthless.</p>

        <p>If you look at Christ's example, here in verse six it states "(He) thought
          it not robbery to be equal with God." Does that sound like low self-esteem or
          worthless to you? No. Jesus was God, He knew He was God, He accepted He
          was God, but He became humble by being a servant. By putting others before
          Himself. By being obedient to the Father. That is true humility. Not
          your neglect of compliments, not your low-self esteem you purposely think
          you must have, not your pride that you try to shrug off when you accomplish
          something. There is a quote that is often attributed to C.S. Lewis, which states
          "True humility is not thinking less of yourself; it is thinking of
          yourself less."</p>

        <p>God didn't call us to be timid, to lack confidence, to be shy or fearful
          of appearing prideful. Because that's what we truly are when we think we must
          "be humble" so others don't think we're prideful. Be humble by simply
          thinking of yourself less, because you are thinking of yourself when you
          "try" to be humble. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with
          giving glory to God, we must! But when we do it to "be humble", it's not.
          Stop it and just put others above yourself. Serve others before you serve
          yourself. And for heaven's sake, just accept a dang compliment every once
          and a while. I assure you, you won't come off as an arrogant prideful jerk.
          But you will if you reject it.</p>
