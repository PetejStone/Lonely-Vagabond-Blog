      <h2>Be Blameless</h2>
      <h4 class="date">July 18, 2016</h4>
      <div class="text">
        <p>I've been reading through Philippians lately and coming across v. 14-15
          of chapter 2 had me in contrition.</p>

        <p>"Do all things without grumbling or disputing, that you may be blameless and
         innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted
         generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world..."</p>

        <p>Now if anyone has known me long enough, or been around me lately, I've been
         kind of a sour puss. It's stupid I know. But I have. I've found that I've
         (again) been discontent and have been grumbling and complaining about pretty
         much anything. If I haven't with my words, my actions have most definitely
         spoken volumes, and for the example I've been setting I can't apologize
         enough.</p>

        <p>In this passage, for being blameless and without blemish, Paul uses
          the Greek word 'amometos', which is named after the greek deity Momus,
          who was a god known for being very judgmental, finding fault in everyone
           and everything... So as if to say, "we should conduct ourselves in such
           a way that even Momus can't find fault in you. "</p>

        <p>Well I didn't need a greek god to point out my flaws. I've had friends
          ever so kindly point it out to me (not sarcasm). But me being the sinful
          idiot I am, have brushed it off. Typical.</p>

        <p>Here I am complaining about stupid petty things that in the grand scale
          and eternal aspect of it all mean absolutely nothing. Then there's Paul...
          Who's already been through a lot, sitting in prison writing these words.
           I mean if anyone had room to complain just a teensy bit, it would have
            been Paul. Nope. He doesn't.</p>

        <p>So to anyone who bothered to read this, consider the example it sets
          when we gripe and complain. It makes the Christian life not look so hot.
           It sets the example that Christ isn't enough. How do you think God feels?
            After all He's given us, we complain.</p>

        <p>I'm reminded of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (I know you've all seen it),
          and that spoiled brat Veruca whose parents had given her everything she's asked.
           And you know what her reaction was!? "Daddy, I want a pony!" Oh no she
           didn't! Well yeah she did, and so do I. All. The. Time.</p>

        <p>So if you're in the same boat as me and have found yourself being discontent
          lately, well, stop it. God's not going to give you a pony with that attitude.
          God didn't even have to wake you up with morning, yet He did. But overall
          this is all more for me than anyone else. God bless.</p>
