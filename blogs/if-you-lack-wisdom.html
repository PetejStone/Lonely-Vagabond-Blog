      <h2>If You Lack Wisdom</h2>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          I have definitely been lacking in the wisdom department as of late. It
          doesn't help when I look within myself to handle situations or to even
           sometimes, make seemingly irrelevant decisions. Decisions have
           consequences, and one needs wisdom to handle those consequences;
           although all consequences could be avoided if wisdom was there to begin
           with.</p>
          <blockquote>"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives
           generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him."
            -James 1:5</blockquote>
          <p>Why do I find wisdom so hard to obtain when God clearly states here
             that He will freely and generously give it to all who ask? Am I asking
             wrong, am I not using the right words? Or do I not recognize wisdom
            when I see it.</p>
          <p>Perhaps it's how I ask. One would assume it's as simple as "Yo God,
            give me wisdom?", maybe it is. Not to go all Greek on you, but "let
            him ask" in this passage is written in the present active imperative
            tense, which means to "keep on asking", or quite literally, "to beg."</p>
          <p>It's not just asking once, but asking over and over and over. Because
            here's the thing, I suck. I know I suck. I know I make sucky decisions
            constantly when left to my own devices and I need God's wisdom. I may
             ask God for wisdom and He may give it to me in that present situation,
             but it's not like He gives me an unlimited supply to where I will
             never screw up again. We are still sinful creatures redeemed by grace,
             and if we don't constantly keep turning towards Christ asking for
             wisdom each and every day, we will continue make sucky decisions.
             That's not to say that we'd be perfect if we had infinite wisdom,
             that's preposterous. But having God's wisdom flowing through our
             veins helps us see clearly the will of God in any given situation,
             and we still have the free will to choose.</p>
            <p>That being said, I have circumstances, perhaps life changing
              circumstances unraveling in my life right now and in the not too distant
              future. I want to make sure I am using wisdom when passing through said
              circumstances. God has me here for a short while longer and I want
              to be sure I finish His work here before I move on towards other things.
               How do I finish His work here? With wisdom.</p>
